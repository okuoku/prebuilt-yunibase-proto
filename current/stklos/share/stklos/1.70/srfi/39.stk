;; This library seems useless since `parameterize` and `make-parameter` are
;; R7RS. However, we can have imageine a library which imports (srfi 39)
;; without importing (scheme base):
;;
;;     (define-library (foo)
;;       (import (srfi 39))
;;       (export radix)
;;       (begin
;;         (define radix (make-parameter 10))))

(define-module srfi/39
  (import (only SCHEME make-parameter parameterize))
  (export make-parameter parameterize))

(provide "srfi/39")
