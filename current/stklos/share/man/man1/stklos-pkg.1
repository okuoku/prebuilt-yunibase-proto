.SH NAME
stklos-pkg \- ScmPkg packages management

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fbstklos-pkg\fR [\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stklos-pkg
command is the general tool for downloading, installing and  uninstalling
.B ScmPkg
packages in STklos.
.LP
The first time you use stklos-pkg you must synchronize your local
repository with the ScmPkg server. This is done using the
\fI--setup\fR option. The other options of stklos-pkg are described
below.

.SH OPTIONS
Here are the options available in the version 1.70 of
.B stklos.

.IP "--extract package | -e package"
extract the files of  \fIpackage\fR (and all its dependencies) and build a
Unix Makefile for compiling the package. The files are extracted in the
directory specified with option \fI--directory\fR (or the current
directory if the option is unused. The generated Makefile offers the
following targets:
.RS
.IP  "all"
to build the package dependencies nd the package itself
.IP "test"
to run package tests
.IP "install"
to install the package (and its dependencies) for the current user
.IP "   system-install"
to install the package (and its dependencies) system-wide
.RE

.IP "--test=package | -t package"
extract and test the given package in a temporary directory. If the
test succeeds, the \fIstklos-pkg\fR command returns 0.

.IP "--install=package| -i package"
install the given package and its dependencies in the standard
installation directory. If the \fI--system-wide\fR flag is not used, files
are installed in the user directory. Otherwise, files are installed in
a shared directory available to all users.

.IP "--uninstall package"
un-install the files which were copied during the installation of the
given package. Use the \fI--system-wide\fR option to un-install shared files.

.IP "--sync | -s"
synchronize the local repository on the ScmPkg server(s). This will
download the description of all the packages which are available on
the server(s). The packages themselves are downloaded, only when
needed.

.IP "--add=package| -a package"
adds the given package to the repository.

.IP "--download=package"
download the tarball associated to given package and copy it in the
current directory or the directory specified by the "--directory"
option.

.IP "--fill-cache"
downloads all the package which are available on the server(s). This
can be used for copying all remote packages, when the net connection
is not permanent for instance.

.IP "--clear-cache"
remove all the packages from the cache. This can be used when packages
files take too much place. Packages will be downloaded when needed

.IP "--reset"
remove all the files needed by ScmPkg, that is the cache of packages,
but also the binary of installed packages, their documentation, and
all the meta-data of ScmPkg.

.IP "--list |-l"
list all the packages which are available from server(s) and from the
current repository.

.IP "--depends=package"
list the packages needed by the given package

.IP "--installed"
list the packages which are locally installed

.IP "--conf-dir=dir | -D dir"
Use the specified directory  as stklos main configuration
directory. This is useful if you use stklos(1) with the \fI-D\fR
option. Note that you can use the \fI-STKLOS_CONFDIR\fR shell variable
for that too.

.IP "--directory=dir | -C dir"
Use the specified directory for extracting file. If this option is not
specified, files are extracted in the current directory.

.IP "--verbose | -v"
be more verbose. Several usage of this flag increase the verbosity of
stklos-pkg.

.IP "--system-wide | -S"
flag used to indicate that (un-)installation must be system wide.

.IP "--version |-V"
display the version of \fIstklos-pkg\fR and exit.

.IP "--help | -h"
Show a list of options

.SH "FILES"
.IP "~/<stklos-conf-dir>/pkg"
The \fISTklos\fR user ScmPkg repository. <stklos-conf-dir> is by
default \fI~/.stklos\fR but can be set by the \fiSTKLOS_CONFDIR\fR
shell variable

.IP "/opt/yunibase/current/stklos/lib/stklos/pkg"
The \fISTklos\fR system ScmPkg repository here

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.IP "STKLOS_CONFDIR"
This variable can be used to designate the directory used by \fBstklos\fR
to store its configuration or packages files. If not set, the default
\fBstklos\fR configuration directory is by default \fB~/.stklos\fR.
