This is vicare-typed.info, produced by makeinfo version 6.5 from
vicare-typed.texi.

This document describes version 0.4.1-devel.3 of Vicare Scheme, an R6RS
compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing single
threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit and 64-bit processors.
_Vicare_ is pronounced the etruscan way.  The focus of this document is
over the typed language extension.
